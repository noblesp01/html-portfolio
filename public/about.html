<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a passionate and driven economist and an evolving developer with a love for turning ideas into functional, innovative solutions. 
My journey into the world of coding began with curiosity, and it has since evolved into a commitment to continuous learning and growth. I specialize in web development, mobile apps and software engineering, with hands-on experience in JavaScript,
Python, SQL, and Flutter.
</p>

<p>What excites me most about development is the ability to solve real-world problems creatively and collaboratively. 
Whether it’s building user-friendly interfaces, optimizing backend systems, or exploring emerging technologies like AI 
and blockchain, I thrive on challenges that push me to think critically and adapt.
</p>

<p>Beyond coding, I’m a God lover and an advocate for clean, maintainable code and believe in the power of teamwork
and open-source contributions. When I’m not debugging or brainstorming new projects, you can find me exploring spiritual things,
tech communities, attending hackathons, or diving into the latest tech trends.
</p>

<p>I’m eager to grow, contribute to impactful projects, and connect with like-minded individuals who share a passion for innovation.
 Let’s build something amazing together!
